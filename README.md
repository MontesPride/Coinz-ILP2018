#Coinz-ILP2018

My first Android game. It is a prototype of a multi-player collaborative location-based game where players collect and exchange virtual coins which have been scattered at random around the University of Edinburghâ€™s Central Area. In the Coinz game, the locations of the coins are specified on a map. Coins are collected by visiting their location on the map, by which we mean that the player literally moves to that location with their mobile phone. A new map is released every day; each map has fifty coins. The object of the game is simply to collect as much money as possible.

During gameplay, players collect coins, storing them in a local wallet, and later pay them into a central bank. However, on any given day, you can only pay in directly a maximum of 25 coins. This means that, even if you collect all 50 coins on the map, there will 25 coins which you will not be able to bank. These unbankable coins (the ones which would exceed your 25-coins-a-day banking allowance) are referred to as spare change. You can message your spare change to another player, and they can pay it into the bank even though they have not collected those coins themselves. Coins which you receive from another player can be messaged over to the bank, even in the case where you have collected and paid in 25 coins already. By exchanging your spare change with another player, you can both increase the total that you have in the bank and thereby make indirect use of coins which were of no use to you directly.

Graphical design wasn't my priority so it doesn't look great but I believe it's bearable.
